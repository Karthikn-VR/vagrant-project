# Vagrant Project & GitHub Pages Deployment

## Overview
This repository (`vagrant-project`) demonstrates:

- Basic web deployment using **GitHub Pages**.
- Automated deployment with **GitHub Actions**.
- Integration with a **self-hosted runner** for CI/CD.

Currently, the repository contains:

- `index.html` — main webpage deployed to GitHub Pages.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — workflow file for automatic deployment on pushes to `main`.

---

## Features Implemented

1. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Deployed the root folder (`.`) containing `index.html`.
   - Used [`peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) GitHub Action.
   - Workflow triggers automatically on pushes to `main`.
   - Uses a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** securely via repository secrets (`GH_PAT`) for authentication.

2. **Self-hosted Runner**
   - Configured a self-hosted runner on a VM.
   - Runner listens for jobs from this repository and executes the workflow.

3. **Workflow Highlights**
   - Checkout repository using `actions/checkout@v4`.
   - Deploy changes to GitHub Pages automatically.
   - Commits for deployment are automatically generated by the workflow.
